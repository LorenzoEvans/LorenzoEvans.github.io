title: In Search Of Hammings Greatness
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! I want to answer [[Richard Hamming]]'s call to do great work.
!! In his book, The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, Hamming states plainly: 

<<<
...with apparently only one life to live on this earth, you ought to try to make significant contributions to humanity..
<<<
!! The question is, //what is great work//?
 
Throughout the book, we get several examples of what Richard Hamming considered great work, along with key aspects of it, and those who do it, and achieving greatness in general, however, as Hamming admits, this is a difficult thing to define in a way that can be explained accurately,,1,,, but there seem to be some patterns- a grab bag, if you will of the following:

* Creating something that contributes to humanity significantly.
* Creating something that can be consumed by the mind.
* Pushing yourself towards, and beyond your limits and biases.
* Developing ways for humanity to do more with less.
* Anything you want it to be.
**This is interesting because it directly points to the creation of knowledge for use by //subsequent generations//, and most of the great achievements (if not all), have been of this type.
* Striving for excellence in a field of your choosing.


Throughout the book, we get walked through many, often first-hand accounts from Hamming's time working at [[Bell Labs]], with people who've done things that are considered great, and achieved greatness, that give us an example of the //kinds// of things he's thinking:

[[Claude Shannon]]'s [[Information Theory]]
[[Coding Theory]], particularly [[Huffman Encoding]],
[[Konrad Zuse]]
Airplanes.
[[Isaac Newton]], [[Gottfried Leibnitz]] and [[Calculus]].
His own [[Error Correcting Codes]] and [[Hamming Distance]]
The Printing Press.
"Computers/Internet."
It may allow us to deal with variety without excessive standardization.
Computers/Internet.
Assembly Lines.
"The Printing Press."

! What does great work require?
Chiefly, while it may come off as surprising, Hamming routinely prioritizes thinking with //style//- perhaps not at all the point one would expect from a course on Science and Engineering cribbed from a talk at a Naval Academy, but that is exactly the point driven home by this- at many times, it is mentioned under other names, such as creativity, originality, novelty, but firstly, and most repetitively, is style.

* Thinking deeply about what the future will hold.
** Adapt your //style// to this.
* Master the fundamentals, and forge your own //style// from them.
* The ability to learn new things.
** //"In a real sense I am engaged in meta-education; the topic of the course is education itself, and hence our discussions must rise above it."//
     What great work is there to be done?
         Addressing Climate Change.
         Advancing Physics.
             A theory of quantum gravity (though perhaps [[Sabine Hossenfelder]] might not agree).
             What are dark matter/energy?
             How did the universe begin
         Advancing Space Travel.
         Updating infrastructure.
         Nuclear Power & Nuclear Proliferation.
         Streaming royalties.
         Decentralization vs. Centralized Incumbents.
     Who is doing or has done great work?
         [[Conor White-Sullivan]]
         [[Anna GÃ¡t]]
         [[David Nolen]]
         [[Jordan Peele]]
         [[David Goggins]]
     What great work excites me?
     What does my answer look like so far?
